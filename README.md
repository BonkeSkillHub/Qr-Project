### What I learned

Used the css-preprocesser to style the project.

I used the feature of creating variables. and the nesting feature of the css-preprocesser

```scss

  $backGroundColor: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  $White: hsl(0,0,100%);
  $lightGray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
```
```scss
.textSection {
    width: 226px;
    height: 226px;
    h3 {
        font-family: 700;
        color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    }
    color: lightgray;
}
```
